# 42 Common Core
This repository is a pointer to the projects from the common core curriculum of school 42 that I have completed. (from the most recent to the oldest)

- [Ft_transcendence](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Ft_transcendence):
"Surprise!"

- [Webserv](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Webserv):
"This project is here to make you write your own HTTP server. You will be able to test it with a real browser. HTTP is one of the most used protocol on internet. Knowing its arcane will be useful, even if you won't be working on a website."

- [Inception](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Inception): 
"This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine."

- [Ft_containers](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Ft_containers): 
"The multiple available containers in C++ all have a very different usage. To make sure you understand them all, let's re-implement them!"

- [CPP-Modules](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/CPP-Modules):
"Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming!"

- [Cub3d](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Cub3d):
"This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way."

- [Net_Practice](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Net_Practice):
"NetPractice is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking."

- [Minishell](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Philosophers):
"The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell."

- [Philosophers](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Philosophers):
"Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger."

- [Pipex](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Pipex):
"This project aims to deepen your understanding of the two concepts that you already know: Redirections and Pipes. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus."

- [Push_swap](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Push_swap):
"This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting."

- [So_long](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/So_long):
"This project is a small 2D game with minilibx. You'll learn about textures, sprites and tiles."

- [Born2beroot](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Born2beroot):
"This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization."

- [Ft_print](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Ft_printf):
"This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects."

- [Get_next_line](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Get_next_line):
"May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects."

- [Libft](https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Libft)
"This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus."
