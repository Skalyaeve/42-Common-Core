# 42
This repository is a pointer the various projects I have been able to complete during my time at school 42 (from the most recent to the oldest).

- Libft: https://github.com/Skalyaeve/Libft
"This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus."
